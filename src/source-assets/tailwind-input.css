/**
# Background

`tailwind-input.wvcss` gets compiled to `tailwind-output.wvcss` upon calling
`npm run tailwind`. The Tailwind CLI successfully picks up any usages of
Tailwind classes within `injected-javascript.wvjs` without any special
configuration needed, thanks to Tailwind v4's automatic source detection:
@see https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v4-beta#automatic-source-detection

Until we have a workflow that ensures `tailwind-output.wvcss` is generated in
dev and release builds and reacts to changes to our JS code, we shall commit it
to source. In future, it would be nice if the source code could import
`tailwind-input.wvcss` and for `tailwind-output.wvcss` to just sneak into the
bundle transparently.

# Known bugs
## Unused classes in output

The v4 Tailwind CLI retains previously-declared classes even if they're unused:
https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14800
The classes remain in the output whether you're using --watch mode or doing a
fresh build and regardless of whether the --optimize/--minify flags are passed.

## Watch mode buggy

Watch mode seems to trigger recompiles even when no relevant file has been
changed. Best to avoid using it for now.
